Autowall Stability Fix (Crash + Reliability)
Fixed autowall crash - removed the wall check that was causing random crashes during wallbangs.
More reliable wallbang checks - autowall now follows the gameGÇÖs own penetration rules to decide if a wall can be shot through.
Correct blocked-shot behavior - shots are still rejected when the wall is too thick or cannot be penetrated.
Min damage is still active - triggerbot only fires wallbang shots when the estimated damage is above your configured minimum.
