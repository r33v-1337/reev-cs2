Triggerbot Aim Mode
Magnet mode - silently corrects your aim toward the target when the triggerbot fires, so bullets land even if your crosshair is slightly off.
Seed mode - compensates for weapon spread so your shots hit exactly where they should, removing the RNG from your bullets.

Public Configs Now Load from GitHub Again
Community configs are now pulled from GitHub instead of Google Drive - the config browser will always show the latest configs available, and new ones are picked up automatically when they're added to the repo.
