Stretched Resolution Fixes
Menu Clicks & Hitboxes Aligned - fixed an issue where clicking on the menu felt offset or unresponsive when playing on stretched resolutions (like 1440x1080).
ESP Lines Up Perfectly - visuals like boxes, names, and health bars now properly anchor to players on non-native resolutions instead of drawing off to the side.
Smoother Menu Dragging - window movement and slider adjustments are now completely accurate to your mouse position across all aspect ratios.
